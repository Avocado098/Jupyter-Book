# ðŸ“– A Little Preface

This Jupyter Book is more than just a collection of notes â€” itâ€™s a curated trail of thoughts, experiments, and discoveries from my deep learning journey. Inside, youâ€™ll find assignments, laboratory tasks, and explorations that shaped my understanding of the subject.

Think of it as a mix between a lab notebook and a storybook: structured enough to be useful, but personal enough to keep things interesting. Some parts may feel like guided tutorials, others like late-night realizations written down before they escaped me.

I hope you not only learn something new but also catch a glimpse of how exciting (and sometimes frustrating) deep learning can be. After all, every code cell tells a story, and every bug fixed is a small victory worth remembering.
